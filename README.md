## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js v20+ and npm
2. A wallet with:
   - ETH on Base Sepolia for gas fees
   - USDC on Base Sepolia for game payments
3. Private key for demo (use wallet connector in production)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
```bash
cd game-test/flappy-x402
```

2. **Set up the server:**
```bash
cd server
npm install

# Create .env file with:
# FACILITATOR_URL=https://x402.org/facilitator
# NETWORK=base-sepolia
# ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
# PORT=3001

npm run dev
```

3. **Set up the client:**
```bash
cd ../client
npm install

# Create .env file with:
# VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

npm run dev
```

4. **Play the game:**
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Click "INSERT COIN" to pay $0.001 USDC
   - Press SPACE or click to fly!
   - When you crash, insert another coin to play again

## 🎨 Game Flow

Just like classic arcade games:
1. **INSERT COIN** - Pay $0.001 USDC
2. **PLAY** - Avoid the pipes as long as you can
3. **GAME OVER** - Your game ends when you hit a pipe
4. **REPEAT** - Insert another coin to play again

No timers, no sessions - just pure arcade gameplay!

## 💰 How x402 Works

1. **Insert Coin**: Click the coin slot button
2. **Payment Request**: Server returns x402 payment requirements
3. **Sign Transaction**: Approve $0.001 USDC transfer
4. **Verification**: Server verifies with x402 facilitator
5. **Game On**: Play until game over!

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS with custom arcade components
- x402-axios for payment handling
- HTML5 Canvas with pixel art rendering

### Backend
- Hono server with x402 middleware
- One payment = one game logic
- CORS support for payment headers
- In-memory session tracking

## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This demo uses private keys directly for simplicity. In production:
- Use wallet connectors (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Never expose private keys in client code
- Implement proper authentication
- Use secure session management
